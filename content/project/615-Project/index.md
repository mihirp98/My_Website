title: Hierarchical Controller for multi-agent Autonomous Racing
summary: Implemented a hierarchical control strategy to compete in a virtual head-to-head racing of 1/10th scale autonomous cars. The controller employs a two-level structure- a high-level planner that generates a reference trajectory that maximizes the progress on the track ensuring obstacle avoidance. Next, we use MPC based tracker for tracking the reference trajectory obtained from the planner. The resulting strategy, capable of completing overtakes, successfully completed the race with a winning rate of 90%.
