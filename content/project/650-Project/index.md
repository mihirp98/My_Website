title: Particle Filter based RGB-D Tracking for Mobile Robots
summary: A Particle Filter based approach for real-time object tracking using mobile robots with an RGB-D camera. The particle filter estimates the location of the object in the global frame and updates the weight of the particles by computing correlation using the 2D feature descriptors of the object inside the bounding box detection. The bounding box detection was obtained using the MobileNet-SSD detection framework.
