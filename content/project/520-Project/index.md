title: Yelp Review Rating Prediction
summary:  Developed and implemented a CNN model for rating prediction and sentiment classification of YELP user restaurant-reviews. For the sentiment classification task, demonstrated that a simpler model which uses only adjectives of the review as its features yield similar results when compared to a complex model that utilizes the entire review.
