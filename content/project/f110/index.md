title: F1/10 Autonomous Racing
summary: Developed a full-autonomy software stack for a F1/10 scaled autonomous racecar in ROS framework. Inclued autonomy modules- time-to-collision based automatic emergency braking, follow-the-gap reactive method, point-to-line metric based iterative-closest-point algorithm for scan-matching, A* and RRT* path-planner, April-tag based pose prediction, raceline optimization, trajectory tracking using Pure Pursuit and Model Predictive Control.
