title: Semantic Scene Composition for Amodal Instance Segmentation
summary: A novel deep learning architecture capable of generating realistic occluded compositions by placing provided individual objects in the scene, in a context-aware manner while preserving the original full masks of the occluded object. Used a combined STN-GAN framework to learn a projection matrix based on encoded geometry and semantic information. Evaluated the generated compositions by fine-tuning a pre-trained Mask-RCNN for the task of amodal instance segmentation and reported the COCO-style mean-Average Precision (mAP) metric.
